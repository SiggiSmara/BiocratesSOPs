## Appendix 7 A: Liquid Chromatography (LC) System Suitability Test
The Testmix must be used to perform a system suitability test before using the Kit. A proper Kit performance
can only be guaranteed when the Testmix run was performed successfully. Also, all system parts must be clean
and the blank levels low. Please find the Testmix vial (label “KIT2/MD01 Testmix”) in the vial box of your Kit. The
Testmix contains a mixture of all derivatized amino acids and biogenic amines (without internal standards) that
are measured by the LC part of the Kit. The Testmix is intended to check your MS instrument sensitivity, as well
as retention times and column condition. Here you find the instructions for using the Testmix.

### 1.  LC-MS Setup
When you have already run a Kit, use the acquisition method of your last Kit run and adjust the retention times
if necessary. If there are no peaks, use the unscheluled MRM method from your Kit installation. When you are
using the Kit for the first time, you find the acquisition methods on the USB stick. For Kit installation, we recom-
mend using the Starter Kit and adjusting the retention times according to section 5.

### 2.  Preparation of the Testmix
The dilution of the Testmix depends on the MS type you are using. The finally prepared Testmix corresponds appro-
ximately to the concentration level of calibration standard 7 (Cal7), which is later measured after Kit preparation.
Note: The Testmix is stable for 1 week at 4°C after preparation.

###SCIEX 6500 Series 
Add 600 μL of 50% methanol (in HPLC grade water) to the Testmix vial
and vortex vigorously. Inject 10 μL.

### 3.  Evaluation of the Testmix Measurement
Note: The stability of ­sarcosine, spermidine and spermine is very low in the Testmix, resulting in low peak intensities.

Criteria | Evaluation
---------|-----------
Sensitivity | The peak intensities of proline (Pro) and phenylanaline (Phe) must be clearly in the e6 intensity range, but should not exceed the intensity range of 8e6 (1e8 on 6500 system) to avoid detector saturation. In case the obtained intensities are higher, it is recommended to dilute the Testmix further or to decrease the injection volume. Please check with Biocrates customer support in this case.
Column Condition | Check if the peak shapes are fine. The peaks may not be split and should have no tailing, otherwise check and reconnect all connection parts. Replace the column if necessary. If the pressure is unexpectedly high, check your LC-MS system for blockage. Replace the pre-column if necessary. ADMA and SDMA must be separated (UHPLC only), and IS Thr must be separated from the interfering peak (see Appendix 8).
Retention Times | Check the retention times of the amino acids and biogenic amines and compare them to your last Kit measurement. If you have not made changes at your LC-MS system, the retention times should be nearly unchanged and stable. In case they have changed, adjust them in your acquisition and quantitation method. Have a look at Appendix 8, page 51 in order to assist with selecting the correct peaks.
